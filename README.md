# MLB Player Projection Analysis

## Introduction
For this project, I observed statistics from 3173 hitters and 1298 pitchers from 2008-2020. The data was obtained from Baseball-Reference.com. The main goal is to predict player value, encompassed in a statistic called Wins Above Replacement (WAR). The scale for WAR is approximately as follows for one full season: 2=average, 5=all-star, 8=MVP.

During the analysis, I seeked to answer the following questions:
1. Which types of players tend to last longer in the league?

2. Which factors are most influential in WAR calculation?

3. Which statistics get too little/too much attention among todayâ€™s front offices?
