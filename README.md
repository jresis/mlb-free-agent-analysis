# MLB Player Projection Analysis

## Introduction
For this project, I observed statistics from 3173 hitters and 1298 pitchers from 2008-2020. The data was obtained from Baseball-Reference.com. The main goal is to predict player value, encompassed in a statistic called Wins Above Replacement (WAR). The scale for WAR is approximately as follows for one full season: 2=average, 5=all-star, 8=MVP.

During the analysis, I seeked to answer the following questions:
1. Which types of players tend to last longer in the league?

2. Which factors are most influential in WAR calculation?

3. Which statistics get too little/too much attention among todayâ€™s front offices?


## Pre-model EDA
Within the baseball industry, bulkier players, or players with a relatively high BMI, tend to get less valuable contracts when they hit free agency. One goal was to determine if these reservations about how these players would age are valid. So, I observed introductory metrics that provide information regarding the relationships between BMI and longevity (as expressed by the max_age, or the oldest a player was when they were in the league). I did the same for the relationship between BMI and WAR after the age of 30. While there were slightly inverse relationships between BMI and longevity/production after age 30, there was no evidence to suggest that BMI should be a key predictor when trying to determine future value. Therefore, it appears that there should be less emphasis on this in the industry.

## Linear Regression
To get a sense of which variables are most important when calculating WAR, I ran linear regressions for the batter and pitcher dataframes. The results were limited, as after addressing multicollinearity issues and statistically insignificant variables, R-Squared for both datasets were .30. So, 30% of the difference in WAR after age 30 between players could be explained by the retained variables. While the linear regression models had their limitations, they offered some conclusions.

For batters, the ability to make contact proved to be a large indicator of success, as higher strikeout rates lead to lower value. The coefficient for strikeout rate was -17.2, so holding other factors constant, a player who strikes out 10% of the time will provide about 3.4 more WAR than a player who strikes out 30% of the time (17.2*(.3-.1)). The linear regression model also highlighted the limits of stolen bases (SB). CS (caught stealing, or failed stolen base attempts) are nearly four times as costly as stolen bases are valuable. As a result, players need to be successful around 79% of the time on stolen bases for them to be worth attempting, which is very difficult, especially in the latter portion of players' careers.

For pitchers, the strikeout-to-walk ratio proved to be an important predictor of success. For the hitter dataframe, we saw how costly high strikeout rates are for hitters, so it is no surprise to see that strikeouts are valuable for pitchers. In addition, to have a good strikeout-to-walk ratio, low walk-rates are required, so the importance of the ratio indicates that good control pays off.
