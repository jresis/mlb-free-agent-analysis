# MLB Player Projection Analysis

## Introduction
For this project, I observed statistics from 3173 hitters and 1298 pitchers from 2008-2020. The data was obtained from Baseball-Reference.com. The main goal is to predict player value, encompassed in a statistic called Wins Above Replacement (WAR). The scale for WAR is approximately as follows for one full season: 2=average, 5=all-star, 8=MVP.

During the analysis, I seeked to answer the following questions:
1. Which types of players tend to last longer in the league?

2. Which factors are most influential in WAR calculation?

3. Which statistics get too little/too much attention among todayâ€™s front offices?


## Pre-model EDA
Within the baseball industry, bulkier players, or players with a relatively high BMI, tend to get less valuable contracts when they hit free agency. One goal was to determine if these reservations about how these players would age are valid. So, I observed introductory metrics that provide information regarding the relationships between BMI and longevity (as expressed by the max_age, or the oldest a player was when they were in the league). I did the same for the relationship between BMI and WAR after the age of 30.
